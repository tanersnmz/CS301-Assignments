# CS301 - Algorithms
### Course description: 
This course is about the analysis and design of computer algorithms. We will study various methods to analyze the correctness and asymptotic performance of algorithms, important algorithms (e.g., search, sort, path finding, spanning tree, network flow) and data structures (e.g., dynamic sets, augmented data structures), algorithmic design paradigms (e.g., randomized, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy, incremental), and hardness of problems (e.g., NP-completeness, reductions, approximation algorithms).

### Course objectives: 
To prepare students 1) to analyze an algorithmâ€™s performance by asymptotic analysis methods, 2) to understand the role of data structures and programming paradigms on the performance of algorithms, 3) to understand a computational problem and its hardness, and 4) to design efficient algorithms taking into account these important factors.
